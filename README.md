# COVID-19 Web Map Application (2020)

This project presents two interactive web maps visualizing COVID-19 data in the United States for the year 2020. The maps were created as part of Lab 3 for GEOG 458 and demonstrate the use of Mapbox GL JS for thematic web mapping.

## Maps

- **Choropleth Map – COVID-19 Case Rates per 1,000 residents**

- **Proportional Symbol Map – Total COVID-19 Cases**

## Project Description

The choropleth map displays county-level COVID-19 case rates per 1,000 residents across the United States. Darker shades represent higher case rates, allowing for easy comparison of relative intensity between counties.

The proportional symbol map visualizes total confirmed COVID-19 cases using scaled circles. Counties with larger case totals are represented by larger symbols, making spatial patterns of case concentration easier to interpret.

## Data Sources

- COVID-19 case data: The New York Times
- Population data: ACS 2018 5-year estimates
